    <h5> We are interested in the dynamics of the brain and how biological neuronal networks process information. Specifically, we are exploring the following questions:</h5>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
        <li>What role do the network connectivity and network dynamics play in the transfer of information from one network to another?</li>
        <li>How neuronal and synapse properties interact with network structure to shape the network activity dynamics?</li>
        <li>How the activity dynamics of the network and information transfer can be controlled by external stimulation?</li>
    </ul>
    To this end, we use analytical methods from statistical mechanics, probability theory, graph theory and control systems theory, and combine them with numerical simulations of large-scale neuronal networks of different brain regions.
    <br> One of the goals of our research is to develop mathematical models of brain diseases and create a theoretical framework to understand the mechanisms underlying the emergence of disease related aberrant activity dynamics in diseases (e.g. Parkinson's diseases, epilepsy, anxiety). Eventually such a quantitive understanding of brain diseases would pave the way for the development of novel brain stimulation protocols to control or correct the disease-related brain activity. Therefore, we are neuralizing the control system theory and developing tools to control the dynamics of neuronal networks by external stimulations methods.</br>
