    <br>In the beginning only the biological brain was considered to be an intelligent system. Now recent advances in machine learning have resulted in non-biological devices which are capable of exhibiting 'intelligent' behavior at least in a restricted sense. Indeed, artificial general intelligence (AGI) still remains a distance dream.
    </br>
    <br> Now to understand general intelligence we need to understand both the biological brain and the machine learning algorithms which redner an agent some intelligence.
    </br>
    <br> In this meeting we bring together experts from Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience to discuss the nature of intelligence. 1
